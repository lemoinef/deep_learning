# Week 1 Of The Deep Learning Nanodegree

## Structure

This week, we had 5 lessons:

- Introduction to the Nanodegree
- Installing Anaconda for Python
- Jupyter Notebook to run our deep learning algorithms
- Applications of Deep learning
- Regression

### Introduction to the Nanodegree

### Anaconda for Python
This is a good package to install python, it has many useful modules within it.

### Jupyter Notebook
Notebooks are essential to data science and machine learning.

### Applications
One fun application is [deepart.io](https://deepart.io/latest/) which changes the style of pictures.
