# Week 1 Of The Deep Learning Nanodegree

## Structure

This week, we had 5 lessons:

- Introduction to the Nanodegree
- Installing Anaconda for Python
- Jupyter Notebook to run our deep learning algorithms
- Applications of Deep learning
- Regression

### Introduction to the Nanodegree

### Anaconda for Python
This is a good package to install python, it has many useful modules within it.

### Jupyter Notebook
Notebooks are essential to data science and machine learning.

### Applications
One fun application is [deepart.io](https://deepart.io/latest/) which changes the style of pictures.

### Regression
In order to implement Siraj's linear regression, we need to activate the environment. Although, in this implementation we do not use matplotlib, another regression used it previously in the course.

- Python 2
`>> conda create -n siraj-regression python=2`
- pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
`>> conda install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn`

The script is provided with this week's folder.

Some additional information about how outliers can affect linear regression was provided.
