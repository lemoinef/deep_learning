# Week 2 Of The Deep Learning Nanodegree

## Structure

This week, we had 2 lessons:

- Siraj's Neural Network
- Intro to Neural Networks
- Project 1


### Siraj's Neural Network
This consisted of a video where we coded a neural network in python. 

### Intro to Neural Networks
We went through logistic regression, gradient descent...

### Project 1
The first project consisted of building a neural net to predict bike rentals.
