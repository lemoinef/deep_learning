# Week 5 Of The Deep Learning Nanodegree

## Structure

This week, we had 1 lesson:

- Intro to Tensorflow

Most of deep learning useful application is about solving perception problems (computer vision, speech recognition). Most big tech companies are tackling deep learning problems.

Deep learning is a powerful set of tools. Now a lot of tools are used in all sorts of problems (vision, speech, etc.).

A lot of work about deep learning as been done in the 80's and 90's, but computing power was not enough. Today, fast GPUs help us.
